# react-native-draftjs-display

React Native component to display Draft.js content.

Partly forked from [jdponomarev/react-native-draftjs-render](https://github.com/jdponomarev/react-native-draftjs-render), with the original code coming from [globocom/react-native-draftjs-render](https://github.com/globocom/react-native-draftjs-render). Re-written to use TypeScript, and to better fit in with my use-case.

## Development

Clone this repository and install its dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lukeramsden/react-native-draftjs-display

```

`yarn run build` builds the library to `dist`.
